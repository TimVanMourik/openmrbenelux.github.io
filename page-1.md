## <span style="color:#004777"> What is the OpenMR Benelux Seminar? </span>

Our goal is to welcome attendees from any background (technical or clinical) and discuss topics related to open science practices in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in medicine, including:

* open tools for machine learning applications in MRI
* data and code sharing practices
* the role of mentoring in facilitating academic careers
* the future of open access publishing
